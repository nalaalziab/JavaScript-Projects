# JavaScript-Projects
A collection of projects built during my JavaScript course
# JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript Projects repository! This collection contains projects, assignments, and challenges completed during my JavaScript course. 

## Purpose
- Demonstrate my progress in learning JavaScript fundamentals and advanced concepts.
- Showcase practical applications of JavaScript (e.g., DOM manipulation, APIs, frameworks).
- Build a portfolio for future employers or collaborators.

## Structure
Projects will be organized by topic or assignment, with clear documentation for each. Folders may include:
- `/beginner-projects` (e.g., calculators, interactive forms)
- `/intermediate-projects` (e.g., API integrations, mini-games)
- `/advanced-projects` (e.g., full-stack apps with JS backends)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Navigate to specific project folders to view code and `README` instructions.
